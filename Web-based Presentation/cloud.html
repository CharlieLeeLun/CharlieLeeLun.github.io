				<h1> What is cloud computing? </h1>
				<p>
					Cloud computing is an upstart technology that has been changing how we work. As early as 1960s, IBM first introduced the concept "Time Sharing" that indicates the first idea of cloud computing. In the past, we use software installed in our computers to create contents. The contents are stored in our computers. However nowadays, we often use cloud computing storage software, such as Google Drive and Microsoft oneDrive, to store and retrieve our assets anywhere. Some researchers have said that it is yet a novel technical revolution or possibly a natural evolution of technology, economy, and culture. Nevertheless, it is obvious that it is changing how students work.
				</p>
				<a name = "student"></a>
				<h1>How is it changing students' behaviour?</h1>
				<p>
					College students have been adopting cloud computing software to assist their school work. It is obvious when in a presentation, students would first log in their account to retrieve their Google Slide presentation file. At first it might seems the reason students use Google Slide is just because of convenience. It is halfly correct.
				</p>
				<p>
					I, as a student in IT course, often use cloud computing software to do project works. Easy retrieval is one of the reasons. I feel more safe logging into my account than bringing a USB drive to school. But most importantly, these software enable students to work in an innovative approach -- collaboration. Software, such as Google Doc, Slide, Spreadsheet provide platform for collaboration. They allow multiple users to access the same file at the same time. What's more is that it allow editing simultaneously, it grealy extend the flexibility of doing projects.
				</p>
				<a name = "how"></a>
				<h1> What technology does it use? </h1>
				<p>
					Cloud computing storage is usually run on virutal machines, think of it as smaller computers inside a computer. In this way, providers can utilize their resource in maximal efficiency. It is because a single users might not use up all the potential of a machine. However, if a machine is used by all users, it may reach its full potential. That's what virtual machines are for. Cloud computing is constructed as multi-tenancy, which means several users are sharing the same virutal machine.
				</p>
				<a name = "security">
				<h1>Security concerns of cloud computing</h1>
				<p>
					Cloud computing is a very promising technology. However, current security approaches might not compensate the uprising security loopholes for cloud computing. Virtual machines, although grealy enhance the efficiency of cloud computing, is exposing lots of weakness of cloud computing. One reason is that when using virutal machines, all of the users share some degree of control over the machine. However, if some users have malicious intentions, they can attack the virutal machines inside out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fortunately, the security of cloud computing has been improved in the following years. A survey conducted in 2012 shows that 60% of virtual machines server is more exploitable than physical servers. But it is predicted to improve to 30% in 2015. The rate is rather promising! Besides, efficiency is the top priority when doing homework.

				<a name = "list"></a>
				<h1> List of cloud computing software </h1>
				<p>
					Here's the list of cloud computing software that I often use and find very useful.
				</p>
				<table border = 1>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>Picture</td>
						<td>Description</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Google Doc</td>
						<td><img class = "small" src = "img/google_doc.png"</td>
						<td>
							<p>
								Word process that are available online and allow multiple users to edit simultaneously. Files can be exported to common file format, such as .doc, .docx, and .pdf.
							</p>
							<p>
								* You may export .pdf to maintain the word formatting
							</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Google Slide</td>
						<td>
							<img class = "small" src = "img/google_slide.png">
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>
								Presentation software that function just similar to the well-known Microsoft PowerPoint. Except that multiple users can edit simultaneously. Files can be exported as .ppt, .pptx, and .pdf.
							</p>
							<p>
								* You may export .pdf to maintain the slide formatting. Though the animation would be lost.
							</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>MindMup 2</td>
						<td>
							<img class = "small" src = "img/mindmup2.png">
						</td>
						<td>
							Available on Google Drive, it is a simple mind map tools that provide basically everything mindmap should have. It is also suitable for creating tree/hierarchical diagrams. Most importantly, it can be viewed and edited by other users as well!
						</td>
					</tr>
						<tr>
						<td>Google Drive</td>
						<td>
							<img class = "small" src = "img/google_drive.png">
						</td>
						<td>
							Google Drive provide 15GB storage space upon google account creation. It allows users to upload anything into it, including images, project files, and even programs! It is available in all computers with internet connection. But beware, do not connect with public WiFi and computers!
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Microsoft OneDrive</td>
						<td>
							<img class = "small" src = "img/microsoft_onedrive.jpg">
						</td>
							
						<td>
							Although slightly worse than Google Drive in my opinion, Microsoft OneDrive is still a useful cloud storage. It is connected with a bunch of Microsoft cloud computing software.
						</td>
